# TODO

- [ ] Come up with a name:)

## Data Collection
- [ ] Be able to take a screenshot and include it in the final evidence document
   - Some functionality in ISDi already, dig around for it
- [ ] Capture & display app install time
- [ ] Capture & display app descriptions
- [ ] Handle inconsistencies coming from ISDI (e.g., the list of permissions)
- [ ] Activity logging for anything the consultant does? Could be printed out along with the evidence document to show authenticity

## Evidence Document
- [ ] Automatically censor client contact info from the document (including screenshots)

## Workflow
- [ ] Change the account compromise section
   - Currently, the consultant selects the accounts they will check and then fills in the details for all of them at once
   - Make it so that the consultant can click a button to add a new account, fill in the details for that account, and repeat as they go through accounts

## Style
- [ ] Improve look of summary page
- [ ] Add option to input info about the abuser so we can tailor the evidence document to the client (e.g., Mark has accessed the phone vs. the person of concern has accessed the phone)
